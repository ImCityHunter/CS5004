# CS5004 Object Oriented Design and Analysis

This class gives us an opportunity write each project in both C++ and Java (required).
For some bigger assignments, we were shown the C++ codes during lecture, and we were asked to write the same project in Java for assignment. (or vice versa).

This class is taught in addition of using C.
